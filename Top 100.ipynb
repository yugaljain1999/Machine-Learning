Shortly nine oclock evening Weyrother drove plans Kutúzovs quarters council war held commanders columns summoned commander chiefs exception Prince Bagratión declined come appointed time Weyrother full control proposed battle eagerness briskness presented marked contrast dissatisfied drowsy Kutúzov reluctantly played part chairman president council war Weyrother evidently felt head movement already become unrestrainable like horse running downhill harnessed heavy cart Whether pulling pushed know rushed along headlong speed time consider movement might lead to Weyrother twice evening enemys picket line reconnoiter personally twice Emperors Russian Austrian report explain headquarters dictated dispositions German now much exhausted arrived Kutúzovs evidently busy even forgot polite commander chief interrupted him talked rapidly indistinctly without looking man addressing reply questions put him bespattered mud pitiful weary distracted air though time haughty selfconfident Kutúzov occupying noblemans castle modest dimensions near Ostralitz large drawing room become commander chiefs office gathered Kutúzov himself Weyrother members council war drinking tea awaited Prince Bagratión begin council last Bagratións orderly came news prince could attend Prince Andrew came inform commander chief and availing permission previously given Kutúzov present council remained room Since Prince Bagratión coming may begin said Weyrother hurriedly rising seat going table enormous map environs Brünn spread out Kutúzov uniform unbuttoned fat neck bulged collar escaping sitting almost asleep low chair podgy old hands resting symmetrically arms sound Weyrothers voice opened one eye effort Yes yes please already late said he nodding head let droop closed eye first members council thought Kutúzov pretending sleep sounds nose emitted reading followed proved commander chief moment absorbed far serious matter desire show contempt dispositions anything else—he engaged satisfying irresistible human need sleep really asleep Weyrother gesture man busy lose moment glanced Kutúzov and convinced asleep took paper loud monotonous voice began read dispositions impending battle heading also read out Dispositions attack enemy position behind Kobelnitz Sokolnitz November 30 1805 dispositions complicated difficult began follows As enemys left wing rests wooded hills right extends along Kobelnitz Sokolnitz behind ponds there we hand left wing far outflank right advantageous attack enemys latter wing especially occupy villages Sokolnitz Kobelnitz whereby fall flank pursue plain Schlappanitz Thuerassa forest avoiding defiles Schlappanitz Bellowitz cover enemys front object necessary that first column marches second column marches third column marches on read Weyrother generals seemed listen reluctantly difficult dispositions tall fairhaired General Buxhöwden stood leaning back wall eyes fixed burning candle seemed listen even wish thought listen Exactly opposite Weyrother glistening wideopen eyes fixed upon mustache twisted upwards sat ruddy Milorádovich military pose elbows turned outwards hands knees shoulders raised remained stubbornly silent gazing Weyrothers face turned away eyes Austrian chief staff finished reading Milorádovich looked round significantly generals one could tell significant look whether agreed disagreed satisfied arrangements Next Weyrother sat Count Langeron who subtle smile never left typically southern French face whole time reading gazed delicate fingers rapidly twirled corners gold snuffbox portrait middle one longest sentences stopped rotary motion snuffbox raised head inimical politeness lurking corners thin lips interrupted Weyrother wishing say something Austrian general continuing read frowned angrily jerked elbows say You tell views later good look map listen Langeron lifted eyes expression perplexity turned round Milorádovich seeking explanation meeting latters impressive meaningless gaze drooped eyes sadly took twirling snuffbox A geography lesson muttered himself loud enough heard Przebyszéwski respectful dignified politeness held hand ear toward Weyrother air man absorbed attention Dohktúrov little man sat opposite Weyrother assiduous modest mien stooping outspread map conscientiously studied dispositions unfamiliar locality asked Weyrother several times repeat words clearly heard difficult names villages Weyrother complied Dohktúrov noted down reading lasted hour over Langeron brought snuffbox rest and without looking Weyrother anyone particular began say difficult carry plan enemys position assumed known whereas perhaps known since enemy movement Langerons objections valid obvious chief aim show General Weyrother—who read dispositions much selfconfidence addressing school children—that do fools men could teach something military matters monotonous sound Weyrothers voice ceased Kutúzov opened eye miller wakes soporific drone mill wheel interrupted listened Langeron said remarking So still silly business quickly closed eye again let head sink still lower Langeron trying virulently possible sting Weyrothers vanity author military plan argued Bonaparte might easily attack instead attacked render whole plan perfectly worthless Weyrother met objections firm contemptuous smile evidently prepared beforehand meet objections might If could attack us would done today said he So think powerless said Langeron He forty thousand men most replied Weyrother smile doctor old wife wishes explain treatment case In case inviting doom awaiting attack said Langeron subtly ironical smile glancing round support Milorádovich near him Milorádovich moment evidently thinking anything rather generals disputing about Ma foi said he tomorrow shall see battlefield Weyrother gave smile seemed say strange ridiculous meet objections Russian generals prove merely convinced of also convinced sovereign Emperors of The enemy quenched fires continual noise heard camp said he What mean Either retreating thing need fear changing position He smiled ironically But even also took position Thuerassa merely saves us great deal trouble arrangements minutest detail remain same How that began Prince Andrew long waiting opportunity express doubts Kutúzov woke up coughed heavily looked round generals Gentlemen dispositions tomorrow—or rather today past midnight—cannot altered said he You heard them shall duty battle nothing important paused than good sleep moved rise generals bowed retired past midnight Prince Andrew went out council war Prince Andrew able express opinion hoped to left vague uneasy impression Whether Dolgorúkov Weyrother Kutúzov Langeron others approve plan attack right—he know But really possible Kutúzov state views plainly Emperor possible account court personal considerations tens thousands lives life life thought must risked Yes likely shall killed tomorrow thought suddenly thought death whole series distant intimate memories rose imagination remembered last parting father wife remembered days first loved her thought pregnancy felt sorry himself nervously emotional softened mood went hut billeted Nesvítski began walk it night foggy fog moonlight gleamed mysteriously Yes tomorrow tomorrow thought Tomorrow everything may me memories more none meaning me Tomorrow perhaps even certainly presentiment first time shall show do fancy pictured battle loss concentration fighting one point hesitation commanders happy moment Toulon long waited presents last firmly clearly expresses opinion Kutúzov Weyrother Emperors struck justness views one undertakes carry out takes regiment division—stipulates one interfere arrangements—leads division decisive point gains victory alone But death suffering suggested another voice Prince Andrew however answer voice went dreaming triumphs dispositions next battle planned alone Nominally adjutant Kutúzovs staff everything alone next battle alone Kutúzov removed appointed Well then asked voice If ten times wounded killed betrayed well then Well then Prince Andrew answered himself I dont know happen dont want know cant want this—want glory want known men want loved them fault want want nothing live that Yes alone shall never tell anyone but oh God love nothing fame mens esteem Death wounds loss family—I fear nothing precious dear many persons me—father sister wife—those dearest me—yet dreadful unnatural seems would give moment glory triumph men love men dont know never shall know love men here thought listened voices Kutúzovs courtyard voices orderlies packing up one voice probably coachmans teasing Kutúzovs old cook Prince Andrew knew called Tit saying Tit say Tit Well returned old man Go Tit thresh bit said wag Oh go devil called voice drowned laughter orderlies servants All same love value nothing triumph all value mystic power glory floating mist CHAPTER XIII night Rostóv platoon skirmishing duty front

conversing German occasionally French drawing room gathered Emperors wish military council the Emperor preferred indefiniteness certain persons whose opinions wished know view impending difficulties council war but were council elucidate certain questions Emperor personally semicouncil invited Swedish General Armfeldt Adjutant General Wolzogen Wintzingerode whom Napoleon referred renegade French subject Michaud Toll Count Stein military man all Pfuel himself who Prince Andrew heard mainspring whole affair Prince Andrew opportunity getting good look him Pfuel arrived soon and passing drawing room stopped minute speak Chernýshev first sight Pfuel illmade uniform Russian general fitted badly like fancy costume seemed familiar Prince Andrew though saw first time something Weyrother Mack Schmidt many German theoristgenerals Prince Andrew seen 1805 typical them Prince Andrew never yet seen German theorist characteristics others united extent Pfuel short thin broadboned coarse robust build broad hips prominent shoulder blades face much wrinkled eyes deep set hair evidently hastily brushed smooth front temples stuck behind quaint little tufts entered room looking restlessly angrily around afraid everything large apartment Awkwardly holding sword addressed Chernýshev asked German Emperor was One could see wished pass rooms quickly possible finish bows greetings sit business front map would feel home nodded hurriedly reply Chernýshev smiled ironically hearing sovereign inspecting fortifications he Pfuel planned accord theory muttered something abruptly bass voice selfassured Germans do—it might stupid fellow the whole affair ruined something absurd come it Prince Andrew catch said would passed on Chernýshev introduced Pfuel remarking Prince Andrew back Turkey war terminated fortunately Pfuel barely glanced—not much Prince Andrew past him—and said laugh That must fine tactical war and laughing contemptuously went room sound voices heard Pfuel always inclined irritably sarcastic particularly disturbed day evidently fact dared inspect criticize camp absence short interview Pfuel Prince Andrew thanks Austerlitz experiences able form clear conception man Pfuel one hopelessly immutably selfconfident men selfconfident point martyrdom Germans are Germans selfconfident basis abstract notion—science is supposed knowledge absolute truth Frenchman selfassured regards personally mind body irresistibly attractive men women Englishman selfassured citizen bestorganized state world therefore Englishman always knows knows Englishman undoubtedly correct Italian selfassured excitable easily forgets people Russian selfassured knows nothing want know anything since believe anything known Germans selfassurance worst all stronger repulsive other imagines knows truth—science—which invented absolute truth Pfuel evidently sort science—the theory oblique movements deduced history Frederick Greats wars came across history recent warfare seemed absurd barbarous—monstrous collisions many blunders committed sides wars could called wars accord theory therefore could serve material science 1806 Pfuel one responsible plan campaign ended Jena Auerstädt see least proof fallibility theory disasters war contrary deviations made theory were opinion sole cause whole disaster characteristically gleeful sarcasm would remark There said whole affair would go devil Pfuel one theoreticians love theory lose sight theorys object—its practical application love theory made hate everything practical would listen it even pleased failures failures resulting deviations practice theory proved accuracy theory said words Prince Andrew Chernýshev present war air man knows beforehand go wrong displeased so unbrushed tufts hair sticking behind hastily brushed hair temples expressed eloquently passed next room deep querulous sounds voice heard there CHAPTER XI Prince Andrews eyes still following Pfuel room Count Bennigsen entered hurriedly nodding Bolkónski pausing went study giving instructions adjutant went Emperor following him Bennigsen hastened make preparations ready receive sovereign Chernýshev Prince Andrew went porch Emperor looked fatigued dismounting Marquis Paulucci talking particular warmth Emperor head bent left listening dissatisfied air Emperor moved forward evidently wishing end conversation flushed excited Italian oblivious decorum followed continued speak And man advised forming camp—the Drissa camp said Paulucci Emperor mounted steps noticing Prince Andrew scanned unfamiliar face as person sire continued Paulucci desperately apparently unable restrain himself the man advised Drissa camp—I see alternative lunatic asylum gallows Without heeding end Italians remarks though hearing them Emperor recognizing Bolkónski addressed graciously I glad see you Go meeting wait me Emperor went study followed Prince Peter Mikháylovich Volkónski Baron Stein door closed behind them Prince Andrew taking advantage Emperors permission accompanied Paulucci known Turkey drawing room council assembled Prince Peter Mikháylovich Volkónski occupied position were chief Emperors staff came study drawing room maps spread table put questions wished hear opinion gentlemen present happened news which afterwards proved false received night movement French outflank Drissa camp first speak General Armfeldt who meet difficulty presented itself unexpectedly proposed perfectly new position away Petersburg Moscow roads reason inexplicable unless wished show he too could opinion urged point army unite await enemy plain Armfeldt thought plan long ago expounded much answer questions put—which fact plan answer—as avail opportunity air it one millions proposals one good another could made long quite unknown character war would take disputed arguments others defended them Young Count Toll objected Swedish generals views warmly anyone else course dispute drew side pocket wellfilled notebook asked permission read them voluminous notes Toll suggested another scheme totally different Armfeldts Pfuels plan campaign answer Toll Paulucci suggested advance attack which urged could alone extricate us present uncertainty trap as called Drissa camp situated discussions Pfuel interpreter Wolzogen his bridge court relations silent Pfuel snorted contemptuously turned away show would never demean replying nonsense hearing Prince Volkónski chair called give opinion merely said Why ask me General Armfeldt proposed splendid position exposed rear Italian gentlemans attack—very fine retreat also good ask me said he Why know everything better do Volkónski said frown Emperors name asked opinion Pfuel rose and suddenly growing animated began speak Everything spoiled everything muddled everybody thought knew better did come me mend matters nothing mend principles laid must strictly adhered to said he drumming table bony fingers What difficulty Nonsense childishness went map speaking rapidly began proving eventuality could alter efficiency Drissa camp everything foreseen enemy really going outflank it enemy would inevitably destroyed Paulucci know German began questioning French Wolzogen came assistance chief spoke French badly began translating him hardly able keep pace Pfuel rapidly demonstrating happened could happen foreseen scheme difficulties whole fault lay fact plan precisely executed kept laughing sarcastically demonstrated last contemptuously ceased demonstrate like mathematician ceases prove various ways accuracy problem already proved Wolzogen took place continued explain views French every turning Pfuel saying Is so excellency Pfuel like man heated fight strikes side shouted angrily supporter Wolzogen Well course explain Paulucci Michaud attacked Wolzogen simultaneously French Armfeldt addressed Pfuel German Toll explained Volkónski Russian Prince Andrew listened observed silence men Prince Andrew sympathized Pfuel angry determined absurdly selfconfident was present evidently alone seeking anything himself nursed hatred anyone desired plan formed theory arrived years toil carried out ridiculous unpleasantly sarcastic yet inspired involuntary respect boundless devotion idea Besides this remarks except Pfuel one common trait noticeable council war 1805 panic fear Napoleons genius which though concealed noticeable every rejoinder Everything assumed possible Napoleon expected every side invoked terrible name shatter others proposals Pfuel alone seemed consider Napoleon barbarian like everyone else opposed theory besides feeling respect Pfuel evoked pity Prince Andrew tone courtiers addressed way Paulucci allowed speak Emperor certain desperation Pfuels expressions clear others knew Pfuel felt fall hand despite selfconfidence grumpy German sarcasm pitiable hair smoothly brushed temples sticking tufts behind Though concealed fact show irritation contempt evidently despair sole remaining chance verifying theory huge experiment proving soundness whole world slipping away him discussions continued long time longer lasted heated became disputes culminating shouts personalities less possible arrive general conclusion said Prince Andrew listening polyglot talk surmises plans refutations shouts felt nothing amazement saying thought long since often occurred military activities—the idea cannot science war therefore thing military genius—now appeared obvious truth What theory science possible matter conditions circumstances unknown cannot defined especially strength acting forces cannot ascertained one able foresee condition enemys armies days time one gauge force detachment Sometimes—when coward front shout ‘We cut off start running brave jolly lad shouts ‘Hurrah—a detachment five thousand worth thirty thousand Schön Grabern times fifty thousand run eight thousand Austerlitz science matter which practical matters nothing defined everything depends innumerable conditions significance determined particular moment arrives one knows when Armfeldt says army cut half Paulucci says got French army two fires Michaud says worthlessness Drissa camp lies river behind it Pfuel says constitutes strength Toll proposes one plan Armfeldt another good bad advantages suggestions seen moment trial speak ‘military genius man genius order bread brought right time say go right left military men invested pomp power crowds sychophants flatter power attributing qualities genius possess best generals known were contrary stupid absentminded men Bagratión best Napoleon admitted that Bonaparte himself remember limited selfsatisfied face field Austerlitz good army commander need special qualities contrary needs absence highest best human attributes—love poetry tenderness philosophic inquiring doubt limited firmly convinced important otherwise sufficient patience brave leader God forbid humane love pity think unjust understandable theory ‘genius invented long ago power success military action depends them man ranks shouts ‘We lost shouts ‘Hurrah ranks one serve assurance useful thought Prince Andrew listened talking roused Paulucci called everyone leaving review next day Emperor asked Prince Andrew would like serve Prince Andrew lost standing court circles forever asking remain attached sovereigns person permission serve army CHAPTER XII beginning campaign Rostóv received letter parents

accused spy flogged flogging over executioner releasing flogging bench stout man red whiskers blue stockings green jacket moaning piteously Another criminal thin pale stood near Judging faces Frenchmen frightened suffering look resembling thin Frenchmans face Pierre pushed way crowd What it it for kept asking attention crowd—officials burghers shopkeepers peasants women cloaks pelisses—was

murmured himself sight tortured Frenchman crowd surrounding Lóbnoe Place Pierre definitely made mind could longer remain Moscow would leave army day seemed either told coachman man ought known himself reaching home Pierre gave orders Evstáfey—his head coachman knew everything could anything known Moscow—that would leave night army Mozháysk saddle horses sent there could arranged day Evstáfeys representation Pierre put departure till next day allow time relay horses sent advance twentyfourth weather cleared spell rain dinner Pierre left Moscow changing horses night Perkhúshkovo learned great battle evening This battle Shevárdino told Perkhúshkovo earth trembled firing nobody could answer questions won dawn next day Pierre approaching Mozháysk Every house Mozháysk soldiers quartered it hostel Pierre met groom coachman room had full officers Everywhere Mozháysk beyond it troops stationed march Cossacks foot horse soldiers wagons caissons cannon everywhere Pierre pushed forward fast could farther left Moscow behind deeper plunged sea troops overcome restless agitation new joyful feeling experienced before feeling akin felt Slobóda Palace Emperors visit—a sense necessity undertaking something sacrificing something experienced glad consciousness everything constitutes mens happiness—the comforts life wealth even life itself—is rubbish pleasant throw away compared something what Pierre could say try determine felt particular delight sacrificing everything occupied question sacrifice for fact sacrificing afforded new joyous sensation CHAPTER XIX twentyfourth August battle Shevárdino Redoubt fought twentyfifth shot fired either side twentysixth battle Borodinó took place battles Shevárdino Borodinó given accepted battle Borodinó fought least sense either French Russians immediate result Russians was bound be brought nearer destruction Moscow—which feared anything world French immediate result brought nearer destruction whole army—which feared anything world result must quite obvious yet Napoleon offered Kutúzov accepted battle commanders guided reason would seem must obvious Napoleon advancing thirteen hundred miles giving battle probability losing quarter army advancing certain destruction must equally clear Kutúzov accepting battle risking loss quarter army would certainly lose Moscow Kutúzov mathematically clear playing draughts one man less go exchanging shall certainly lose therefore exchange opponent sixteen men fourteen one eighth weaker he exchanged thirteen men three times strong am battle Borodinó strength proportion French five six battle little one two previously hundred thousand hundred twenty thousand afterwards little fifty thousand hundred thousand Yet shrewd experienced Kutúzov accepted battle Napoleon said commander genius gave it losing quarter army lengthening lines communication still more said expected end campaign occupying Moscow ended previous campaign occupying Vienna much evidence contrary Napoleons historians tell us Smolénsk onwards wished stop knew danger extended position knew occupation Moscow would end campaign seen Smolénsk state Russian towns left him received single reply repeated announcements wish negotiate giving accepting battle Borodinó Kutúzov acted involuntarily irrationally later on fit occurred historians provided cunningly devised evidence foresight genius generals who blind tools history enslaved involuntary ancients left us model heroic poems heroes furnish whole interest story still unable accustom fact epoch histories kind meaningless question battle Borodinó preceding battle Shevárdino fought also exists definite wellknown quite false conception historians describe affair follows Russian army say retreat Smolénsk sought best position general engagement found position Borodinó Russians say fortified position advance left highroad from Moscow Smolénsk almost right angle it Borodinó Utítsa place battle fought front position say fortified outpost set Shevárdino mound observe enemy twentyfourth told Napoleon attacked advanced post took it and twentysixth attacked whole Russian army position field Borodinó histories say quite wrong anyone cares look matter easily convince himself Russians seek best position but contrary retreat passed many positions better Borodinó stop one positions Kutúzov wish occupy position chosen popular demand battle yet expressed strongly enough Milorádovich yet arrived militia many reasons fact positions passed stronger position Borodinó the one battle fought far strong position spot one might find Russian Empire sticking pin map hazard Russians fortify position field Borodinó left of right angle to highroad that is position battle took place never till twentyfifth August 1812 think battle might fought there shown first fact entrenchments twenty fifth begun twentyfifth twentysixth completed secondly position Shevárdino Redoubt redoubt quite senseless front position battle accepted strongly fortified post efforts exhausted six thousand men sacrificed defend till late night twentyfourth Cossack patrol would sufficed observe enemy Thirdly proof position battle fought foreseen Shevárdino Redoubt advanced post position fact twentyfifth Barclay de Tolly Bagratión convinced Shevárdino Redoubt left flank position Kutúzov report written hot haste battle speaks Shevárdino Redoubt left flank position much later reports battle Borodinó written leisure incorrect extraordinary statement invented probably justify mistakes commander chief represented infallible Shevárdino Redoubt advanced post—whereas reality simply fortified point left flank—and battle Borodinó fought us entrenched position previously selected whereas fought quite unexpected spot almost unentrenched case evidently this position selected along river Kolochá—which crosses highroad right angle acute angle—so left flank Shevárdino right flank near village Nóvoe center Borodinó confluence rivers Kolochá Vóyna anyone looks field Borodinó without thinking battle actually fought position protected river Kolochá presents obvious army whose object prevent enemy advancing along Smolénsk road Moscow Napoleon riding Valúevo twentyfourth see as history books say did position Russians Utítsa Borodinó he could seen position exist see advanced post Russian army pursuing Russian rearguard came upon left flank Russian position—at Shevárdino Redoubt—and unexpectedly Russians moved army across Kolochá Russians time begin general engagement withdrew left wing position intended occupy took new position foreseen fortified crossing side Kolochá left highroad Napoleon shifted whole forthcoming battle right left looking Russian side transferred plain Utítsa Semënovsk Borodinó—a plain advantageous position plain Russia—and whole battle twentysixth August took place Napoleon ridden evening twentyfourth Kolochá ordered immediate attack redoubt begun attack next morning one would doubted Shevárdino Redoubt left flank position battle would taken place expected it case probably defended Shevárdino Redoubt—our left flank—still obstinately attacked Napoleon center right engagement would taken place twentyfifth position intended fortified attack left flank took place evening retreat rear guard that is immediately fight Gridnëva Russian commanders wish time begin general engagement evening twentyfourth first chief action battle Borodinó already lost twentyfourth obviously led loss one fought twentysixth loss Shevárdino Redoubt found morning twentyfifth without position left flank forced bend back hastily entrench chanced be Russian army twentysixth defended weak unfinished entrenchments disadvantage position increased fact Russian commanders—not fully realized happened namely loss position left flank shifting whole field forthcoming battle right left—maintained extended position village Nóvoe Utítsa consequently move forces right left battle happened throughout whole battle Russians opposed entire French army launched left flank half many men Poniatowskis action Utítsa Uvárovs right flank French actions distinct main course battle battle Borodinó take place in effort conceal commanders mistakes even cost diminishing glory due Russian army people described battle Borodinó fought chosen entrenched position forces slightly weaker enemy but result loss Shevárdino Redoubt Russians fought battle Borodinó open almost unentrenched position forces half numerous French say conditions merely unthinkable fight ten hours secure indecisive result unthinkable keep army even complete disintegration

submitted marshals personally giving commands generals original line Russian forces along river Kolochá dislocated capture Shevárdino Redoubt twentyfourth part line—the left flank—had drawn back part line entrenched front ground open level elsewhere evident anyone military not French attack would seem much consideration needed reach conclusion particular care trouble part Emperor marshals need

battle would still full genius Russia would lost face world changed historians believe Russia shaped one man—Peter Great—and France republic became empire French armies went Russia one man—Napoleon—to say Russia remained power Napoleon bad cold twentyfourth August may seem logical convincing depended Napoleons fight fight battle Borodinó arrangement depended will evidently cold affecting manifestation might saved Russia consequently valet omitted bring Napoleon waterproof boots twentyfourth would savior Russia Along line thought deduction indubitable indubitable deduction Voltaire made jest without knowing jesting at saw Massacre St Bartholomew due Charles IXs stomach deranged men admit Russia formed one man Peter I French Empire formed war Russia begun one man Napoleon argument seems merely untrue irrational contrary human reality question causes historic events another answer presents itself namely course human events predetermined high—depends coincidence wills take part events Napoleons influence course events purely external fictitious Strange first glance may seem suppose Massacre St Bartholomew due Charles IXs will though gave order thought done result order strange may seem suppose slaughter eighty thousand men Borodinó due Napoleons will though ordered commencement conduct battle thought done ordered it strange suppositions appear yet human dignity—which tells us is least less man great Napoleon—demands acceptance solution question historic investigation abundantly confirms it battle Borodinó Napoleon shot one killed one done soldiers Therefore killed people French soldiers went kill killed battle Borodinó Napoleons orders volition whole army—French Italian German Polish Dutch—hungry ragged weary campaign felt sight army blocking

strength soon began fail him looking him conscious said much amiss got calèche drove back silence wrath expended return blinking feebly listened excuses selfjustifications Ermólov come see till next day insistence Bennigsen Konovnítsyn Toll movement miscarried executed next day Kutúzov consent CHAPTER VI Next day troops assembled appointed places evening advanced night autumn night dark purple clouds rain ground damp muddy troops advanced noiselessly occasionally jingling artillery could faintly heard men forbidden talk loud smoke pipes strike light tried prevent horses neighing secrecy undertaking heightened charm marched gaily columns supposing reached destination halted piled arms settled cold ground majority marched night arrived places evidently been Count OrlóvDenísov Cossacks the least important detachment all got appointed place right time detachment halted outskirts forest path leading village Stromílova Dmítrovsk Toward dawn Count OrlóvDenísov dozed off awakened deserter French army brought him Polish sergeant Poniatowskis corps explained Polish come slighted service ought long ago made officer braver them left wished pay out said Murat spending night less mile were would let convoy hundred men would capture alive Count OrlóvDenísov consulted fellow officers offer tempting refused Everyone volunteered go everybody advised making attempt much disputing arguing MajorGeneral Grékov two Cossack regiments decided go Polish sergeant Now remember said Count OrlóvDenísov sergeant parting if lying Ill hanged like dog its true shall hundred gold pieces Without replying sergeant resolute air mounted rode away Grékov whose men quickly assembled disappeared forest Count OrlóvDenísov seen Grékov off returned shivering freshness early dawn excited undertaken responsibility began looking enemy camp visible deceptive light dawn dying campfires columns ought begun appear open declivity right looked direction though columns would visible quite far off seen seemed count things beginning stir French camp keensighted adjutant confirmed this Oh really late said Count Orlóv looking camp often happens someone trusted longer eyes suddenly seemed quite clear obvious sergeant impostor lied whole Russian attack would ruined absence two regiments would lead away heaven knew where could one capture commander chief among mass troops I sure rascal lying said count They still called back said one suite like Count Orlóv felt distrustful adventure looked enemys camp Eh Really think let go not Will fetched back Fetch back fetch back said Count Orlóv sudden determination looking watch It late quite light adjutant galloped forest Grékov Grékov returned Count OrlóvDenísov excited abandoned attempt vainly awaiting infantry columns still appear well proximity enemy resolved advance men felt excitement Mount commanded whisper men took places crossed themselves Forward Gods aid Hurrahahah reverberated forest Cossack companies trailing lances advancing one another poured sack dashed gaily across brook toward camp One desperate frightened yell first French soldier saw Cossacks camp undressed waking up ran directions abandoning cannons muskets horses Cossacks pursued French without heeding behind around them would captured Murat everything there officers desired impossible make Cossacks budge got booty prisoners None listened orders Fifteen hundred prisoners thirtyeight guns taken spot besides standards what seemed important Cossacks horses saddles horsecloths like dealt with prisoners guns secured booty divided—not without shouting even little fighting among themselves—and Cossacks busied themselves French farther pursued began recover themselves formed detachments began firing OrlóvDenísov still waiting columns arrive advanced further Meantime according dispositions said the First Column march on infantry belated columns commanded Bennigsen directed Toll started due order and always happens got somewhere appointed places always happens men starting cheerfully began halt murmurs heard sense confusion finally backward movement Adjutants generals galloped about shouted grew angry quarreled said come quite wrong late gave vent little abuse last gave went forward simply get somewhere We shall get somewhere other indeed get somewhere though right places eventually even got right place late use time fired at Toll battle played part Weyrother Austerlitz galloped assiduously place place finding everything upside everywhere Thus stumbled Bagovúts corps wood already broad daylight though corps long joined OrlóvDenísov Excited vexed failure supposing someone must responsible it Toll galloped commander corps began upbraiding severely saying ought shot General Bagovút fighting old soldier placid temperament also upset delay confusion crosspurposes fell rage everybodys surprise quite contrary usual character said disagreeable things Toll I prefer take lessons anyone die men well anybody said advanced single division Coming onto field enemys fire brave general went straight ahead leading men fire without considering agitation whether going action now single division would use no Danger cannon balls bullets needed angry mood One first bullets killed him bullets killed many men division remained fire time quite uselessly CHAPTER VII Meanwhile another column attacked French front Kutúzov accompanied column well knew nothing confusion would come battle undertaken will far power held troops back advance rode silently small gray horse indolently answering suggestions attack The word attack always tongue dont see unable execute complicated maneuvers said Milorádovich asked permission advance We couldnt take Murat prisoner morning get place time nothing done now replied someone else Kutúzov informed French rear—where according reports Cossacks previously nobody—there two battalions Poles gave sidelong glance Ermólov behind spoken since previous day You see asking attack making plans kinds soon one gets business nothing ready enemy forewarned takes measures accordingly Ermólov screwed eyes smiled faintly hearing words understood storm blown over Kutúzov would content hint Hes little fun expense said Ermólov softly nudging knee Raévski side Soon this Ermólov moved Kutúzov respectfully remarked It late yet Highness—the enemy gone away—if order attack not Guards much see little smoke Kutúzov reply reported Murats troops retreat ordered advance though every hundred paces halted three quarters hour whole battle consisted OrlóvDenísovs Cossacks done rest army merely lost hundreds men uselessly consequence battle Kutúzov received diamond decoration Bennigsen diamonds hundred thousand rubles others also received pleasant recognitions corresponding various grades following battle fresh changes made staff Thats everything done us topsyturvy said Russian officers generals Tarútino battle letting understood fool things wrong done so people speak today people talk like either know talking deliberately deceive themselves battle—Tarútino Borodinó Austerlitz—takes place planned anticipated essential condition countless number free forces for nowhere man freer battle question life death influence course taken fight course never known advance never coincides direction one force many simultaneously variously directed forces act given body direction motion cannot coincide one forces always mean—what mechanics represented diagonal parallelogram forces descriptions given historians especially French ones find wars battles carried accordance previously formed plans conclusion drawn descriptions false battle Tarútino obviously attain aim Toll view—to lead troops action order prescribed dispositions Count OrlóvDenísov may view—to take Murat prisoner result immediately destroying whole corps Bennigsen others may view aim officer wished go action distinguish himself Cossack wanted booty got on aim battle actually resulted Russians day desired—to drive French Russia destroy army—it quite clear battle Tarútino incongruities exactly wanted stage campaign would difficult even impossible imagine result opportune actual outcome battle minimum effort insignificant losses despite greatest confusion important results whole campaign attained transition retreat advance exposure weakness French administration shock Napoleons army awaited begin flight CHAPTER VIII Napoleon enters Moscow brilliant victory de la Moskowa doubt victory battlefield remains hands French Russians retreat abandon ancient capital Moscow abounding provisions arms munitions incalculable wealth Napoleons hands Russian army half strength French make single attempt attack whole month Napoleons position brilliant either fall Russian army double strength destroy it negotiate advantageous peace case refusal make menacing move Petersburg even case reverse return Smolénsk Vílna remain Moscow short special genius would seem required retain brilliant position French held time that simple easy steps necessary allow troops loot prepare winter clothing—of sufficient Moscow whole army—and methodically collect provisions according French historians enough Moscow supply whole army six months Yet Napoleon greatest geniuses historians declare control army took none steps merely nothing kind contrary used power select foolish ruinous courses open him Napoleon might done wintering Moscow advancing Petersburg NízhniNóvgorod retiring northerly southerly route say road Kutúzov afterwards took nothing stupid disastrous imagined actually did remained Moscow till October letting troops plunder city then hesitating whether leave garrison behind him quitted Moscow approached Kutúzov without joining battle turned right reached MáloYaroslávets without attempting break take road Kutúzov took retiring instead Mozháysk along devastated Smolénsk road Nothing stupid could devised disastrous army sequel showed Napoleons aim destroy army skillful strategist could hardly devised series actions would completely accomplished purpose independently anything Russian army might do Napoleon man genius this say destroyed army wished to stupid would unjust say brought troops Moscow wished clever genius cases personal activity force personal activity soldier merely coincided laws guided event historians quite falsely represent Napoleons faculties weakened Moscow results justify actions employed ability strength best could army done previously subsequently 1813 activity time less astounding Egypt Italy Austria

longer corporal went away The affair alluded happened days before—a fight prisoners French soldiers Pierre succeeded pacifying comrades prisoners heard Pierre talking corporal immediately asked Frenchman said Pierre repeating told army leaving Moscow thin sallow tattered French soldier came door shed Rapidly timidly raising fingers forehead way greeting asked Pierre whether soldier Platoche

dreadful moments lived executions forever washed away imagination memory agitating thoughts feelings formerly seemed important occur think Russia war politics Napoleon plain things business his called judge concerning therefore could so Russia summer weather bound together thought repeating words Karatáevs found strangely consoling intention killing Napoleon calculations cabalistic number beast Apocalypse seemed meaningless even ridiculous anger wife anxiety name smirched seemed merely trivial even amusing concern somewhere woman leading life preferred matter anybody especially him whether found prisoners name Count Bezúkhov often remembered conversation Prince Andrew quite agreed him though understood Prince Andrews thoughts somewhat differently Prince Andrew thought said happiness

satisfaction ones needs consequent freedom choice ones occupation is ones way life seemed Pierre indubitably mans highest happiness first time fully appreciated enjoyment eating wanted eat drinking wanted drink sleeping wanted sleep warmth cold talking fellow man wished talk hear human voice satisfaction ones needs—good food cleanliness freedom—now deprived this seemed Pierre constitute perfect happiness choice occupation is way life—now restricted—seemed easy matter forgot superfluity comforts life destroys joy satisfying ones needs great freedom choice occupation—such freedom wealth education social position given life—is makes choice occupation insolubly difficult destroys desire possibility occupation Pierres daydreams turned time would free Yet subsequently rest life thought

Berëzina disorganized crowds French numerically superior aim Russians consisted cutting capturing Napoleon marshals—and aim merely frustrated attempts attain shamefully baffled—then last period campaign quite rightly considered French series victories quite wrongly considered victorious Russian historians Russian military historians far submit claims logic must admit conclusion spite lyrical rhapsodies valor devotion forth must reluctantly admit French retreat Moscow series victories Napoleon defeats Kutúzov putting national vanity entirely aside one feels conclusion involves contradiction since series French victories brought French complete destruction series Russian defeats led total destruction enemy liberation country source contradiction lies fact historians studying

attainment quite impossible would senseless first Napoleons disorganized army flying Russia possible speed say every Russian desired use performing various operations French running away fast possibly could Secondly would senseless block passage men whose whole energy directed flight Thirdly would senseless sacrifice ones troops order destroy French army without external interference destroying

pursuing French could keep them cavalry artillery horses broke down information received movements French never reliable men Russian army worn continuous marching rate twentyseven miles day could go

strong reached Krásnoe fifty thousand rapidity Russian pursuit destructive army flight French theirs difference Russian army moved voluntarily threat destruction hung French sick Frenchmen left behind enemy hands sick Russians left behind among people chief cause wastage Napoleons army rapidity movement convincing proof corresponding decrease Russian army Kutúzov far power instead trying check movement French desired Petersburg Russian army generals directed whole activity here done Tarútino Vyázma hastening easing movement army besides this since exhaustion enormous diminution army caused rapidity advance become evident another reason slackening pace delaying presented Kutúzov aim Russian army pursue French road French would take unknown closer troops trod heels greater distance cover following distance could one cut across zigzag path French artful maneuvers suggested generals meant fresh movements army lengthening marches whereas reasonable aim shorten marches end Kutúzovs activity directed whole campaign Moscow Vílna—not casually intermittently consistently never deviated it Kutúzov felt knew—not reasoning science whole Russian being—what every Russian soldier felt French beaten enemy flying must driven out time like soldiers realized hardship march rapidity unparalleled time year generals especially foreign ones Russian army wished distinguish themselves astonish somebody reason capture king duke—it seemed now—when battle must horrible senseless—was time fight conquer somebody Kutúzov merely shrugged shoulders one another presented projects maneuvers made soldiers—illshod insufficiently clad half starved—who within month without fighting battle dwindled half number best flight continued would go greater distance already traversed reached frontier longing distinguish themselves maneuver overthrow cut showed particularly whenever Russians stumbled French army Krásnoe expected find one three French columns stumbled instead Napoleon sixteen thousand men Despite Kutúzovs efforts avoid ruinous encounter preserve troops massacre broken mob French soldiers wornout Russians continued Krásnoe three days Toll wrote disposition The first column march so etc usual nothing happened accord disposition Prince Eugène Württemberg fired hill French crowds running past demanded reinforcements arrive French avoiding Russians dispersed hid forest night making way round best could continued flight Milorádovich said want know anything commissariat affairs detachment could never found wanted—that chevalier sans peur et sans reproche  styled

sabers urging horses could scarcely move trotted much effort column presented them—that say crowd Frenchmen stark cold frostbitten starving—and column presented threw arms surrendered long anxious do Krásnoe took twentysix thousand prisoners several hundred cannon stick called marshals staff disputed distinguished pleased achievement—though much regretted taken Napoleon least marshal hero sort reproached one another especially Kutúzov failed so men carried away passions blind tools melancholy law necessity considered heroes imagined accomplishing noble honorable deed blamed Kutúzov said beginning campaign prevented vanquishing Napoleon thought nothing satisfying passions would advance Linen Factories comfortable there Krásnoe checked advance learning Napoleon quite lost head probable understanding Napoleon bribed him on on contemporaries carried away passions talk way posterity history acclaimed Napoleon grand Kutúzov described foreigners crafty dissolute weak old courtier Russians something indefinite—a sort puppet useful Russian name CHAPTER V 1812 1813 Kutúzov openly accused blundering Emperor dissatisfied him history recently written order Highest Authorities said Kutúzov cunning court liar frightened name Napoleon blunders Krásnoe Berëzina deprived Russian army glory complete victory French   History year 1812 character Kutúzov reflections unsatisfactory results battles Krásnoe Bogdánovich fate great men grands hommes Russian mind acknowledge rare always solitary individuals who discerning Providence submit personal it hatred contempt crowd punish men discerning higher laws Russian historians strange terrible say Napoleon—that insignificant tool history never anywhere even exile showed human dignity—Napoleon object adulation enthusiasm grand Kutúzov—the man beginning end activity 1812 never swerving word deed Borodinó Vílna presented example exceptional history selfsacrifice present consciousness future importance happening—Kutúzov seems something indefinite pitiful speaking year 1812 always seem little ashamed yet difficult imagine historical character whose activity unswervingly directed single aim would difficult imagine aim worthy consonant whole people Still difficult would find instance history aim historical personage completely accomplished Kutúzovs efforts directed 1812 Kutúzov never talked forty centuries looking Pyramids sacrifices offered fatherland intended accomplish accomplished general said nothing himself adopted pose always appeared simplest ordinary men said simplest ordinary things wrote letters daughters Madame de Staël read novels liked society pretty women jested generals officers soldiers never contradicted tried prove anything him Count Rostopchín Yaúza bridge galloped Kutúzov personal reproaches caused destruction Moscow said How promised abandon Moscow without battle Kutúzov replied And shall abandon Moscow without battle though Moscow already abandoned Arakchéev coming Emperor said Ermólov ought appointed chief artillery Kutúzov replied Yes saying myself though moment said quite contrary matter him—who alone amid senseless crowd understood whole tremendous significance happening—what matter whether Rostopchín attributed calamities Moscow himself Still less could matter appointed chief artillery merely cases continually old man—who experience life reached conviction thoughts words serving expression move people—use quite meaningless words happened enter head man heedless words whole time activity utter one word inconsistent single aim toward moved throughout whole war Obviously spite himself diverse circumstances repeatedly expressed real thoughts bitter conviction would understood Beginning battle Borodinó time disagreement began alone said battle Borodinó victory repeated verbally dispatches reports time death alone said loss Moscow loss Russia reply Lauristons proposal peace said peace peoples will alone retreat French said maneuvers useless everything accomplished better could desire enemy must offered a golden bridge neither Tarútino Vyázma Krásnoe battles necessary must keep force reach frontier with would sacrifice single Russian ten Frenchmen courtier described us lies Arakchéev please Emperor alone—incurring thereby Emperors displeasure—said Vílna carry war beyond frontier useless harmful words alone prove understood meaning events actions—without smallest deviation—were directed one threefold end 1 brace strength conflict French 2 defeat them 3 drive Russia minimizing far possible sufferings people army procrastinator Kutúzov whose motto Patience Time enemy decisive action gave battle Borodinó investing preparations unparalleled solemnity Kutúzov battle Austerlitz began said would lost alone contradiction everyone else declared till death Borodinó victory despite assurance generals battle lost despite fact army retire winning battle unprecedented alone whole retreat insisted battles useless then fought new war begun frontiers Russia crossed easy understand significance events—if abstain attributing activity mass aims existed heads dozen individuals—for events results lie us old man alone opposition general opinion truly discern importance peoples view events activity never untrue it source extraordinary power penetrating meaning events occuring lay national feeling possessed full purity strength recognition fact possessed feeling caused people strange manner contrary Tsars wish select him—an old man disfavor—to representative national war feeling placed highest human pedestal he commander chief devoted powers slaying destroying men saving showing pity them simple modest therefore truly great figure could cast false mold European hero—the supposed ruler men—that history invented lackey man great lackey conception greatness CHAPTER VI fifth November first day called battle Krásnoe Toward evening—after much disputing many mistakes made generals go proper places adjutants sent counterorders—when become plain enemy everywhere flight could would battle Kutúzov left Krásnoe went Dóbroe whither headquarters day transferred day clear frosty Kutúzov rode Dóbroe plump little white horse followed enormous suite discontented generals whispered among behind back along road groups French prisoners captured day there seven thousand them crowding warm campfires Near Dóbroe immense crowd tattered prisoners buzzing talk wrapped bandaged anything able get hold of standing road beside long row unharnessed French guns approach commander chief buzz talk ceased eyes fixed Kutúzov who wearing white cap red band padded overcoat bulged round shoulders moved slowly along road white horse One generals reporting guns prisoners captured Kutúzov seemed preoccupied listen general saying screwed eyes dissatisfied look gazed attentively fixedly prisoners presented specially wretched appearance disfigured frostbitten noses cheeks nearly red swollen festering eyes One group French stood close road two them one face covered sores tearing piece raw flesh hands something horrible bestial fleeting glance threw riders malevolent expression which glance Kutúzov soldier sores immediately turned away went doing Kutúzov looked long intently two soldiers puckered face screwed eyes pensively swayed head another spot noticed Russian soldier laughingly patting Frenchman shoulder saying something friendly manner Kutúzov expression face swayed head What saying asked general continuing report directed commander chiefs attention standards captured French standing front Preobrazhénsk regiment Ah standards said Kutúzov evidently detaching difficulty thoughts preoccupied him looked absently Thousands eyes looking sides awaiting word him stopped front Preobrazhénsk regiment sighed deeply closed eyes One suite beckoned soldiers carrying standards advance surround commander chief them Kutúzov silent seconds then submitting evident reluctance duty imposed position raised head began speak throng officers surrounded him looked attentively around circle officers recognizing several them I thank all said addressing soldiers officers stillness around slowly uttered words distinctly heard I thank hard faithful service victory complete Russia forget you Honor forever paused looked around Lower head lower it said soldier accidentally lowered French eagle holding Preobrazhénsk standards Lower lower thats it Hurrah lads added addressing men rapid movement chin Hurrrah roared thousands voices soldiers shouting Kutúzov leaned forward saddle bowed head eye lit mild apparently ironic gleam You see brothers said shouts ceased voice expression face changed longer commander chief speaking ordinary old man wanted tell comrades something important stir among throng officers ranks soldiers moved might hear better going say You see brothers know its hard you cant helped Bear up wont long now Well see visitors well rest Tsar wont forget service hard you still home they—you see come to said he pointing prisoners Worse poorest beggars strong didnt spare ourselves may even pity them human beings too Isnt so lads looked around direct respectful wondering gaze fixed upon read sympathy said face grew brighter brighter old mans mild smile drew corners lips eyes cluster wrinkles ceased speaking bowed head perplexity But asked here Serves right bloody bastards cried suddenly lifting head flourishing whip rode gallop first time whole campaign left broken ranks soldiers laughing joyfully shouting Hurrah Kutúzovs words hardly understood troops one could repeated field marshals address begun solemnly changing old mans simplehearted talk hearty sincerity speech feeling majestic triumph combined pity foe consciousness justice cause exactly expressed old mans goodnatured expletives merely understood lay soul every soldier found expression joyous longsustained shouts Afterwards one generals addressed Kutúzov asking whether wished calèche sent for Kutúzov answering unexpectedly gave sob evidently greatly moved CHAPTER VII troops reached nights halting place eighth November last day Krásnoe battles already growing dusk day calm frosty occasional lightly falling snow toward
